== Developement notes for typeclass resolution caching ==

To cache:
1. Goal.goal
2. Evars
3. autoinfo

=== Concerns: ===
* If we cache all failed searches, cache search size could become quite large. To be tested in real life with simple placeholder implementation/

=== Questions: ===
* How to integrate cache into search monads?

=== Discussion with Matthieu at POPL'18: ===

* Use `Progress.goal_equals` instead `Goal.V82.same_goal`
* Use hints from autoinfo
* Hint_db.t equality but OK to start with =
* autoinfo: ignore depth, last_tac, search_cut
* Do not cache failures due to hint cut.
* `hints_tac` invokes monad
* How to pass cache:
  1. put cache into info
  2. Or global mutable ref
  3. or add ref to Logic monad
* Talk to Arnaud Spiwack about passing cache.
